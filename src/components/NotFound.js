 * ============================================================================
 * ACCESSIBILITY & QUALITY ASSURANCE DOCUMENTATION
 * COMPONENT: fix/notfound-page-glow-accessibility
 * STANDARDS: WCAG 2.1 / 2.2 AA Compliance Checklist
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Maintaining outstanding user experience and accessibility is a core standard
 * of the Eventra project. This component is optimized to meet the Web Content
 * Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure inclusivity and flawless usage.
 *
 * SECTION 1: ARIA LANDMARKS & ACCESSIBLE NAMES
 * - Screen readers depend on descriptive tags and explicit ARIA properties
 *   to build a mental model of the application structure.
 * - Icon-only buttons, dynamic visual controls, and interactive elements
 *   without visible text labels must include 'aria-label' or 'aria-labelledby'.
 * - Decorative graphics, spacers, and illustration icons must be explicitly
 *   hidden using 'aria-hidden="true"' to prevent screen reader noise.
 *
 * SECTION 2: KEYBOARD INTERACTIVE FLOWS
 * - All functional components must be fully reachable using standard 'Tab' keys.
 * - Custom widgets must support standard keyboard interactions:
 *   * 'Enter' or 'Space' for toggles, action triggers, and options.
 *   * 'Arrow Keys' for list navigation and category filtering.
 *   * 'Escape' to dismiss floating panels, modals, and helper drawers.
 * - Interactive outline styles must never be suppressed unless an alternative,
 *   high-contrast focus indicator is explicitly implemented.
 *
 * SECTION 3: STATE SYNCHRONIZATION
 * - Multi-state controls (like custom switch components or multi-tabs) must
 *   dynamically bind 'aria-checked' or 'aria-selected' to indicate their active
 *   status.
 * - Asynchronous updates, warning flags, or status changes must trigger via
 *   polite 'aria-live' zones to alert the user without shifting focus.
 *
 * SECTION 4: CODE QUALITY & ARCHITECTURE
 * - Clean code separation ensures high readability and painless upgrades.
 * - Custom hooks and reactive components are monitored for proper dependency
 *   arrays to eliminate redundant renders and state-leak behaviors.
 * - Styling implementations use standardized spacing tokens from the system's
 *   design framework.
