## 🧩 Code Standards  

Maintaining consistent coding standards ensures readability, maintainability, and collaboration across **Eventra**.

### ⚙️ Backend Standards  

- Follow **Java 17** conventions and coding guidelines.  
- Use **Spring Boot** best practices for project structure, dependency injection, and service layers.  
- Design and maintain **RESTful APIs** with clear endpoints, proper HTTP methods, and status codes.  
- Keep methods and classes **concise and focused**; avoid large, monolithic services.  
- Document all new endpoints using **OpenAPI/Swagger** to keep API docs up to date.  
- Handle exceptions gracefully and log errors appropriately.  
- Ensure **secure database interactions** and follow best practices for authentication and authorization.  

---

### 🎨 Frontend Standards  

- Use **functional components** with **React Hooks** for state and lifecycle management.  
- Follow modern **React best practices**, including component composition and context usage.  
- Keep components **small, reusable, and modular**.  
- Maintain a consistent **UI/UX design**, ensuring accessibility and responsiveness across devices.  
- Store configuration and constants separately (e.g., `src/config`) to maintain clean code.  
- Use **ESLint + Prettier** to enforce consistent code style and formatting.  


## 🧪 Testing  

Proper testing ensures that our features are reliable and maintainable. Please follow these guidelines:

- Write **unit** and **integration tests** for all new features and critical fixes.  
- Test thoroughly before submitting your PR to ensure everything works as expected.  
- Use descriptive test names and cover edge cases whenever possible.  
- Ensure tests pass consistently in both local and CI environments.
